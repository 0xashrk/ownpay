## The Story

![OwnPay Origin Story](my-win-qoute-post.png)

> "Built this straight after landing in NYC from EthDenver and was basically bothered by [this](https://x.com/base/status/1895938456041423003) and its inefficient ways of merchants accepting payments" - [@0xashrk](https://twitter.com/0xashrk)

After witnessing Base network's approach at EthDenver - where food truck merchants had to get customers to scan wallet address barcodes - we knew there had to be a better way. Coming from London where Apple Pay's tap-to-pay experience is ubiquitous, the idea of holding up barcodes felt like a step backward. While QR codes work in Asia, they're cumbersome and potentially insecure when printed on paper.

**We built OwnPay to bring that satisfying Apple Pay "ding" to Web3 payments.**

## Overview
OwnPay is a mobile cryptocurrency payment layer - think PayPal for Web3 - that enables fast, secure, and user-friendly transactions on the Monad blockchain. Unlike traditional wallets, OwnPay works with your existing wallet infrastructure while providing a seamless payment interface. The app facilitates proximity-based payments using Bluetooth technology, allowing users to make payments to nearby devices without the need for QR code scanning or address sharing for each transaction.

> "Instant, contactless, on-chain payments as effortlessly as Apple Pay - secure, fast, and fully on-chain." - Monad Devs
